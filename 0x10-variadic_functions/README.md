C - Variadic functions 📁

TASKS 📃

0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant
•	Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
•	Prototype: int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
•	If n == 0, return 0

1. To be is to be the value of a variable
•	Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
•	Prototype: void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
•	where separator is the string to be printed between numbers and n is the number of integers passed to the function
•	You are allowed to use printf
•	If separator is NULL, don’t print it
•	Print a new line at the end of your function

2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable
•	Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
•	Prototype: void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
•	where separator is the string to be printed between the strings and n is the number of strings passed to the function
•	You are allowed to use printf
•	If separator is NULL, don’t print it
•	If one of the string is NULL, print (nil) instead
•	Print a new line at the end of your function

3. To be is a to be the value of a variable
•	Write a function that prints anything.
•	Prototype: void print_all(const char * const format, ...);
•	where format is a list of types of arguments passed to the function
•	c: char
•	i: integer
•	f: float
•	s: char * (if the string is NULL, print (nil) instead
•	any other char should be ignored
•	see example
•	You are not allowed to use for, goto, ternary operator, else, do ... while
•	You can use a maximum of
•	2 while loops
•	2 if
•	You can declare a maximum of 9 variables
•	You are allowed to use printf
•	Print a new line at the end of your function
